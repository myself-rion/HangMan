# HangMan
Hangman game using Python <br>
How to play ? - <br>

<strong>
1. It will think of a word.
The player will guess letters one at a time. <br>
2. If the letter is in the word, it will reveal it in its correct position. <br>
3. If the letter is not in the word, it will draw a part of the hangman. <br>
4. The game ends when the player has guessed all the letters in the word or when the program has completed the hangman.

## Updates

I am hoping to add more features in near future.
